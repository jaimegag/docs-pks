<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic explains how to upgrade the <%= vars.product_full %> tile and existing Kubernetes clusters.

For information about upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration, see
[Upgrading <%= vars.product_short %> with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
 
The supported upgrade paths to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x are from PKS v1.3.x and later. On Azure, <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x is compatible with Ops Manager v2.4.2 and Ops Manager v2.4.3 only. For all other IaaS, <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x is compatible with Ops Manager v2.4.2+ and v2.5.x. 

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Do not manually upgrade your Kubernetes version. The <%= vars.product_short %> service includes the compatible Kubernetes version.</p>

Before you begin the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [Prerequisites](#before) section to plan and prepare your upgrade.

After you complete the prerequisite steps, continue to the procedures in the [During the Upgrade](#upgrade) section. These steps guide you through the process of upgrading the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, upgrading Ops Manager, importing an updated stemcell, and applying the changes to your deployment.

After you complete the upgrade, follow the procedures in the [After the Upgrade](#after-upgrade) section to verify that your upgraded <%= vars.product_short %> deployment is running properly.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Upgrading from PKS v1.2.5+ to PKS v1.3.x causes all
certificates to be automatically regenerated. The old certificate authority is still trusted and
has a validity of one year. The new certificates are signed with a new certificate authority and is
valid for four years.</p>

### <a id="prepare"></a>Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin upgrading the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, perform the following steps:

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version or versions of <%= vars.product_short %> you are upgrading to.

1. Review [What Happens During <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html), and evaluate your workload capacity and uptime requirements.

1. View your workload resource usage in Dashboard. For more information, see [Accessing Dashboard](access-dashboard.html).
  1. If workers are operating too close to their capacity, the PKS upgrade can fail. To prevent workload downtime during a cluster upgrade, Pivotal recommends running your workload on at least three worker VMs, using multiple replicas of your workloads spread across those VMs. For more information, see [Maintaining Workload Uptime](maintain-uptime.html).
  1. If your clusters are near capacity for your existing infrastructure, Pivotal recommends scaling up your clusters before you upgrade.
Scale up your cluster by running `pks resize` or create a cluster using a larger plan. For more information, see [Scaling Existing Clusters](scale-clusters.html).

1. Verify that your Kubernetes environment is healthy. To verify the health of your Kubernetes environment, see [Verifying
Deployment Health](verify-health.html#k8s).

1. (Optional) Back up the PKS v1.3 control plane. For more information, see [Backing up and Restoring PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/backup-and-restore.html).

## <a id="upgrade"></a> During the Upgrade

This section describes the steps required to upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x:

1. [Upgrade to PKS v1.2.7 or Later](#upgrade-pks)
1. [Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.4.2 or Later](#upgrade-opsman)
1. [Upgrade to PKS v1.3.1 or Later](#upgrade-tile-1-3)
1. [Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x](#upgrade-tile-1-4)
1. [Download and Import the Stemcell](#stemcell)
1. [Verify Errand Configuration](#worker-nodes)
1. [Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile](#apply-changes)

### <a id="upgrade-pks"></a>Upgrade to PKS v1.2.7 or Later

Skip this step if you are already running PKS v1.2.7 or later.

To upgrade to PKS v1.2.7 or later, follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-2/upgrade-pks.html) in the PKS v1.2 documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-opsman"></a>Upgrade to Ops Manager v2.4.3 or Later

Before you upgrade to PKS v1.3.x and PKS v1.4.x, you must upgrade to Ops Manager v2.4.3 or later.

1. Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrade Ops Manager and Installed Products to v2.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#upgrade_ops).

1. <%= partial 'add-clusters-workloads' %>

### <a id="upgrade-tile-1-3"></a>Upgrade to PKS v1.3.1 or Later

Follow the procedures detailed in [Upgrading PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/upgrade-pks.html) in the PKS v1.3 documentation.

### <a id="upgrade-tile-1-4"></a>Upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x

To upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x, follow the same Ops Manager process that you use to install the tile for the first time.

Your configuration settings migrate to the new version automatically. Follow the steps below to perform an upgrade.

1. Review the [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for the version you are upgrading to.

1. Download the desired version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to **<%= vars.product_tile %>**. This adds the tile to your staging area.

### <a id="stemcell"></a>Download and Import the Stemcell

<%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x uses a [Xenial stemcell](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/stemcells/#xenial).

If Ops Manager does not have the Xenial stemcell required for <%= vars.product_short %>, the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile displays the message **Missing stemcell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the <b>Stemcell Library</b> in Ops Manager already has a compatible Xenial stemcell,
  the <b>Missing stemcell</b> link does not appear. You do not need to download or import a new stemcell and can skip this step.</p>

To download and import a new Xenial stemcell, follow the steps below:

1. On the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, click on the **Missing stemcell** link.

    <img src="images/missing_stemcell.png" alt="Verify stemcell assignment">

1. In the **Stemcell Library**, locate **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile and note the required stemcell version.

1. Visit the [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/) page on Pivotal Network,
and download the required stemcell version appropriate for your IaaS.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager, and click on **Stemcell Library**.

1. On the **Stemcell Library** page, click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded from Pivotal Network.

1. Select <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and click **Apply Stemcell to Products**.

1. Verify that Ops Manager successfully applied the stemcell. The stemcell version you imported and applied appears in the **Staged** column for <%= vars.product_tile %>.

1. Select the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

### <a id="worker-nodes"></a>Verify Errand Configuration

To verify that errands are configured correctly in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, perform the following steps.

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.

1. Click **Errands**.

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, verify that the **Upgrade all clusters errand** is set to **Default (On)**. The errand upgrades a single Kubernetes cluster at a time. Upgrading PKS-deployed Kubernetes clusters can temporarily interrupt the service, as described in [Service Interruptions](interruptions.html).

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: If you are upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, you must enable the <strong>Upgrade All Clusters</strong> errand.</p>

1. Under **Post-Deploy Errands**, set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. The errand uses the PKS Command Line Interface (PKS CLI) to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

1. Review the other configuration panes. Click **Save** on any panes where you make changes.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>, you must place singleton jobs in the AZ you selected when you first installed the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. You cannot move singleton jobs to another AZ.</p>

### <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Changes to the <%= vars.product_tile %> Tile

Perform the following steps to complete the upgrade to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
     For more information about this Ops Manager page, see
    [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. (Optional) To monitor the progress of the **Upgrade all clusters errand** using the BOSH CLI, do the following:
      1. Log in to the BOSH Director by running `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT log-in` from a VM that can access your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment. For more information, see [Managing <%= vars.product_short %> Deployments with BOSH](manage-deployments-bosh.html).
      1. Run `bosh -e MY-ENVIRONMENT tasks`.
      1. Locate the task number for the errand in the <strong>&#35;</strong> column of the BOSH output.
      1. Run `bosh task TASK-NUMBER`, replacing `TASK-NUMBER` with the task number you located in the previous step.

## <a id="after-upgrade"></a>After the Upgrade

After you complete the upgrade to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.4.x, complete the following verifications and upgrades:

- [Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs](#update-clis)
- [Verify the Upgrade](#verify-upgrade)
- [Upgrade vSphere](#upgrade-vcenter)

### <a id="update-clis""></a>Update PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

Update the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs on any local machine
where you run commands that interact with your upgraded version of <%= vars.product_short %>.
